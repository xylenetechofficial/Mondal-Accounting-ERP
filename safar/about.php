                    <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;font-size: 25px;">Our Inspiration Behind our proud venture....</h2>
                    <p>Carfixpro is an entrepreneurial start-up launched by Mr Vikas Kumar. As we say that necessity is the mother of invention, the idea of carfixpro also originated from one such sweet but a sour personal incident. His reminiscence of that fateful evening has inspired Mr Vikas Kumar to incept, plan, conceive and finally execute this unique 24x7 service on the road venture, Carfixpro.
                        " It was a hot summer late afternoon. Mr Kumar was travelling to Delhi via the Faridabad highway with his parents. As his driver was on leave, he had to drive his Swift Desire all by himself. Despite the scorching heat he was enjoying his pleasant drive on the countryside.
                        But the very next moment there was a loud thud which startled them. As the car started wobbling, he patiently pulled over his car. The front left side tyre was torn apart due to excessive heat. Although Mr Kumar wasn't pro at changing the tyres but he still managed to replace it with the spare tyre from the boot box. Once everything was done and dusted, they resumed their onward journey. As the sun was setting down, the highway was getting darker. After driving few more kilometres their right-side tyre was punctured.
                        Mr Kumar realised that this is going to be a panicky situation. As they didn't have any sparer tyres to change. His parents were slightly restless due to the heat and tiredness. Mr Kumar was running from pillar to post in search of a mechanic. He frantically tried various car service numbers available on the net, but all in vain. Unfortunately, he had to take lift from a passer-by to the nearest petrol pump. Eventually, he got both tyres fixed at a puncture centre. And reached the site of his stranded car along with a motor mechanic, who charged exorbitant price for this off hours service. But as they say, all is well that ends well. Finally, they started driving back at 12:30 am at night.”
                        But this entire episode was just a beginning of a new journey for Mr Vikas Kumar. This unpleasant incident left him brooding over the thought that every day hundreds of people drive to and for on our highways in and around NCR. And not everyone is lucky enough to get timely help at odd hours. What if their car is stranded?
                        On narrating this incidence to his family, Mr Kumar's father came up with a noble idea of starting an on-the-road express car service. Where they will have a team of expert technicians and mechanics available 24x7. A car fixing professional team who could reach the needy passengers at odd hours. Also, they should be approachable on a single click or via phone call on a toll-free number. Mr Kumar's vision was to build a team which was reliable and approachable yet affordable.
                        Voila, with this excellent thought Carfixpro was born. It is an affordable multifaceted professional team available 24x7 in the Faridabad and Gurugram area, with free pickup and delivery facility."
                        Carfixpro isn't a mere start-up. It's an inspiration from the personal experience. We don’t want our fellow citizens, friends and family to face a similar unforeseen, unpleasant situation in future. In case you get stuck or stranded please remember that Carfixpro is Always There for you!!
